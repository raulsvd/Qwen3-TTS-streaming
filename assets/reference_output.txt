There's a new movie out, Leave the World Behind, where there were cyberattacks. They focused on first isolating people—taking away their phone, TV, internet—then doing some misinformation so they get paranoid and start killing each other. That was the whole point of that movie, and they're pertaining that that's something that could happen. It’s going to be a very dangerous time. I hope it's not as nasty as what I see, but I see some very nasty stuff coming.
